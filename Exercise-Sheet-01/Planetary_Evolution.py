The following are the referenced equations in the code:
Eq(1), Eq(2) : Euler algorithm for r(t+dt) and v(t+dt)
Eq(3), Eq(3) : Verlet algorithm for r(t+dt) and v(t)
Eq(4), Eq(5) : Velocity-Verlet algorithm for r(t+dt) and v(t+dt)
Please see the report for an in-depth formulation.

The code consists in two main classes: PARTICLE and SYSTEM. Planets are modelled as particles
and the Solar System as a system. The class particle contains all the informations about a given
particle (mass, position, velocity, net_force). The class system contains all the particles and
meaningful informations about the system, such as potential and kinetic energy of the whole
ensemble of particles.
