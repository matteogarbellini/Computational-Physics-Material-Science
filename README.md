Simulations and Exercise Sheets for the course "Computational physics: material science" by Prof. Dzubiella at the University of Freiburg

The following are the proposed simulations/tutorials/exercise sheets (in chronological order):

- Exercise Sheet 01: Solar system and planetary evolution
- Exercise Sheet 02: (MD) Lennard-Jones fluid
- Exercise Sheet 03: (MD) Lennard-Jones fluid with radial distribution function 
- Exercise Sheet 04: (MD) Lennard-Jones fluid confined between two walls
