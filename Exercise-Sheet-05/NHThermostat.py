Exercise Sheet 03 - Radial Distribution function (RDF) of LJ fluid in NVE microcanonical ensemble

*Objective*
The objective of this exercise is to implement a function that calculates the radial distribution
function g(r), the isothermal compressibility (k_T). It is also asked to run a 2D simulation for
a longer time interval than the previous simulation

*Comments*
It is to be noted that the modules used in this simulation are the same as the previous one,
where the new routines are added. The goal is to add all the new routine from week to week.
